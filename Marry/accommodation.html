We recommend any of the below options, most of which are within a 10-15 minute drive of Round Barn Farm. We've also included a few VRBOs for those of you looking to stay in a house with a group of family or friends. We'll be working with a local shuttle company to coordinate pick-ups and drop-offs at select locations before and after the wedding.</p>
